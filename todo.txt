General:
- publish the demo on my site
- add documentation

Script:
- Investigate the css fixed support across browser
- Add option to use jquery ui css framework
- Humanized style is somewhat wacky
- Think about a notification of type 'error message' in place. Think about a delete button which got an error.
  Where would you display it?
- Add default prefix for css class
- Add an optional title

Done:
* Add different type of messages (info, warning, error). It would just attach a different css class
* Work on themes (rounded corners)
* Test it on different browsers
* give the demos a nice layout
